     <h1>About Me</h1>
     
     <p>
      Hello! My name is Marta Deneke. I graduated from Western Washington University in 2020 with an MIS degree. During my undergrad, I held different occupations such as Receptionist, Gallery attendant, and Co-organizer.
      After taking some computer courses at WWU I wanted to expand my skills, which is when I decided to start taking classes at Code Fellows. I am very excited to grow my skills within the IT industry.
